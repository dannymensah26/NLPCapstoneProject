## Project Description

    The Covid_vaccine-tweet-analytics-app is a Streamlit web application that uses pre-trained models from Huggingface to classify the sentiment of tweets related to Covid-19 vaccines.

    The app allows users to enter a keyword or phrase related to Covid-19 vaccines and displays the sentiment analysis of the resulting tweets in real-time.

    The models used in the app include BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT, which are state-of-the-art natural language processing models.

    More details on the modelling can be found here and here

    The app also includes a visualization of the sentiment analysis results, allowing users to easily see the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral tweets related to Covid-19 vaccines.
